# obliterator
Literally DESTROY web endpoint(s) with a single command, for load testing

Set of IaC templates/configs, helper utilities, startup scripts, etc. to
deploy as many virtual machines as you want to blast a web endpoint with
requests. Maybe it'll wrap [locust](https://locust.io), or maybe just GNU
Parallel. But it'll fuckin' WRECK your website. Pray that it survives.

Or, you know, design it so it does. That's the point.
